    "CommunityUser1": "I want you to tell me when and how to protect yourself, so we don’t let the children out. But you should know that I work with people who can’t read or write. I also want to know how pesticides affect me and the children, because I am concerned that my sister’s son has developmental problems from pesticides",
    "CommunityUser2": "What type of pesticide are they going to put, because not only do we want them to tell us when they are going to put a pesticide. No. We want it to be general, that any type of pesticide, be it good or bad, be notified.",
    "CommunityUser3": "I have lived in Nyeland Acres for 17 years and have been working in the fields ever since. I think a notification system that tells us what chemicals are used is very important because I don’t know what chemicals are used where we are working, and they always smell."
